“A Meditative Sound Journey” 

This song came about in an iterative process that combined aspects of live coding and facets of my own relaxation and study routine. I knew I wanted to include the key melody from my favorite piano piece “I Wanted to Leave” by SYML, so after placing it at the center of the code, I built body and drama around it. Recently, I have been incorporating sound meditation and breathe work into my routine, so when I began coding, I wanted a slow heartbeat and rolling beat to set the pace of the song so that any listener can try to sow their heartrate to match the pace of the song. Finally, I wanted the production to be absent of a drumbeat. 
With these brainstorming ideas in mind, I sat for about 4 hours and slowly built the song. I have no prior experience with music theory or song composition, so this was a largest hurtle I had to overcome during this process.
